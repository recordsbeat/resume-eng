## üí™ What I‚Äôm good at

- Knowing JPA(hibernate) lifecycle to avoid unintended query & performance decline <br>
[Query tuning and solving N+1 using QueryDsl - from my blog](https://github.com/recordsbeat/resume-eng/blob/a275fd280ca51d9c9df37c48a34e57ebff157ff4/Query%20tuning%20and%20solving%20N+1%20using%20QueryDsl.md) <br>
[Resolving OutOfMemory caused by JPA hibernate Query Plan Cache - from my blog](https://github.com/recordsbeat/resume-eng/blob/a275fd280ca51d9c9df37c48a34e57ebff157ff4/Resolving%20OutOfMemory%20caused%20by%20JPA%20hibernate%20Query%20Plan%20Cache.md) 

- Enhancing transaction performance in Batch application by index optimization and decrease locking duration <br>
[Handling Transaction Concurrency Using JPA - from my blog](https://github.com/recordsbeat/resume-eng/blob/a275fd280ca51d9c9df37c48a34e57ebff157ff4/Handling%20Transaction%20Concurrency%20Using%20JPA.md) <br>

## üìù What I have done

### Auto-Scheduler restart when it failed
- Logging result meta-data using Scheduler annotation 
- Success & fail alarm to Slack (chatOps & SRE oriented)

### MethodRouter based Spring AOP
- Implementation of strategy pattern 
- Routing method by comparing requested value to reserved value

### Domain driven oriented architecture design
- Define domain model as a POJO
- Isolate domain aggregate by package boundary
- Communication between domain package by using facade, inbound event


<br>


## üìë What I‚Äôm working on

### Component Test within MSA
- Building testing environment with docker-compose 
- Describe test case by method fixture
- Enhance test performance by reusing container 

### Debezium(CDC)
- Establish Debezium instance in Kubernetes
- Planning database instance fail over strategy
- Adding on Kafka Connect (including debezium) management tool (Debezium UI)


<br><br>


## üëÇ What I‚Äôm interested in

### Virtual thread (a.k.a project loom) 
- Lightweight thread(fiber) will set us free from thread performance so that we don‚Äôt need to deal with non-blocking operation for performance

### Shenandoah GC (a.k.a Low-pause)
- Load reference barrier enables not only concurrent marking swap but also compact(evacuation) 
- Expect it will shrink GC pause time dramatically at Server API application

[Low-Pause ! Shenandoah GC - from my blog](https://github.com/recordsbeat/resume-eng/blob/a275fd280ca51d9c9df37c48a34e57ebff157ff4/Low-Pause%20!%20Shenandoah%20GC.md) <br>

### Consumer Driven Contract Test (a.k.a Pact)
- Consumer generates Pact, so client side won't need to wait anymore until server gives Api spec(such as swagger)
- Pact broker shows commnication relcationship between each microservice
- Handling Pact's version and history easliy (living document)
