## 💪 What I’m good at

- Knowing JPA(hibernate) lifecycle to avoid unintended query & performance decline
- Enhancing transaction performance on Batch application by index optimization and decrease locking duration


## 👂 What I’m interested in

### Virtual thread (a.k.a project loom) 
- Lightweight thread(fiber) will set us free from thread performance so that we don’t need to deal with non-blocking operation for performance

### Shenandoah GC (a.k.a Low-pause)
- Load reference barrier enables not only concurrent marking swap but also compact(evacuation) 
- Expect it will shrink GC pause time dramatically at Server API application

### Consumer Driven Contract Test (a.k.a Pact)
- Consumer generates Pact, so client side won't need to wait anymore until server gives Api spec(such as swagger)
- Pact broker shows commnication relcationship between each microservice
- Handling Pact's version and history easliy (living document)
